# __TideShift-Map-Ranker-o-matic__
Incredible, one of a kind, never before seen, o-matic Starcraft 2 Map Ranking machine. It doesnt automatically rank anything but that's not the point, stop nitpicking.

## Instructions
-Over to the right on this web page is a "Release" section. Click on it.

Good Job!

-Ok now, Drop down the "assets" box. It may already be dropped down. You can do it, I believe in you.

Wow! such good!

-click the .exe file and download.

-Open the exe file.
You've come so far!

Upon opening, you'll be presented with a meticulously hand crafted graphical user interface (aka GUI). This GUI was designed by yours truly, using the finest mahogany and pieced together code from god knows where. Frankly, even I am suprsied it works.

Please close your mouth.

-nce you get over the intial shock and awe of such beauty please direct your one non lazy eye to the drop down that houses each map. This tells you what map youre ranking. Now slightly lower your eyes... errr... I mean eye.... You'll see 4 categories to rank. Choose a number for each. Do not worry, it peaks out at 3. It'll be ok, you got this. 
After choosing a number for each category click "submit" and on to the next map it will go.

When you make it through all of the maps you will get a nice message and you will have also contributed more to society in those last few moments than you ever have in your entire life.

!Congratulations! 

-Pat yourself on the back, close the program, and piss off.
